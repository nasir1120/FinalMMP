        <h1>Here's Mirage</h1>
        <p>The goal of this website is for you to learn about one of the greatest men to live during our generation, Mirage. Mirage may seem like a normal person however when you look at his eyes you can clearly see that he has two different eyes.Along with his two eyes Mirage has the ability to turn into creatures/animals from any time period and even myths. </p>

   </body>Mirage originally comes from the United States but eventually was forced to move to the island of Kyushu,Japan.The people that live there tend to throw festivals in order to forget about the war even if it's only for a short time. Other than the city, the island is filled with lots of wildlife and beautiful trees. Compared to New York where there's skyscrapers Kyushu is definitely a completely different place.

The main thing that helped to inspire me was anime and Beast from Teen Titans. Whenever I watch anime I think of creating something similar but with my own ideas as well. You can specifically see how anime comes into play through the design of Mirage as well as how Teen Titans affects my character. I chose to make a series of animations using photoshop. The animation is meant to be about how the war being fought in my characters story changed him. The way I created this using photoshop was by putting multiple layers into a timeline effect which would move throughout all the individual layers like a slideshow.</p>
